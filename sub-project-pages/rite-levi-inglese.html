          <div class="body-text" align="justify">Marie Curie was a French physicist born in Warsaw, Poland. She was famous for helping to discover two radioactive elements, polonium and radium, and for her work on radioactivity. Curie won two Nobel prizes and is the only woman in history to have won the Prize in two different fields - Physics (1903) and Chemistry (1911).</div>
        </div>
	<div class="subheader-text" align="justify">Early life</div>
	  <div class="body-text" align="justify">Marie Curie was born Maria Salomea Sklodowski 7th November 1867 in Warsaw. Poland. Both her parents were teachers and gave importance to receiving a good education, but women in her city could not study to get a university degree. Maria was determined to become a scientist and saved enough money to move to Paris, France and study physics at the university of the Sorbonne. In 1906, Curie became the first woman to teach at the famous French university</div>
	<div class="subheader-text" align="justify">A Love Story</div>  
	  <div class="body-text" align="justify">After her studies, she started to work with a French scientist called Pierre Curie and they got married in 1895.  Together they discovered two new elements: polonium (named after her home country of Poland) and radium, which are radioactive and give off rays of energy. They had two daughters. Irène went on to continue her mother’s work while Ève wrote a biography about her mother’s life. Their love story ended when Pierre died in 1906.</div>
	<div class="subheader-text" align="justify">Career</div>
	  <div class="body-text" align="justify">Curie’s discovery of polonium and radium were important because the invisible rays could pass through solid matter and conduct electricity and her understanding of radioactivity would help save lives.  During the first World War, Curie created x-ray units that could be taken to battlefield hospitals in France and these allowed doctors to see broken bones and bullets inside the bodies of wounded and hurt soldiers.</div>
	<div class="subheader-text" align="justify">Death and legacy</div>
          <div class="body-text" align="justify">Unfortunately, Marie did not know that she was working with dangerous materials that could make her ill. She died 4th July, 1934, from overexposure to radiation because of her experiments and work with x-ray machines. Her work has contributed greatly to the fields of science and medicine. She remains a great inspiration and has demonstrated that women can study and become important.</div>
