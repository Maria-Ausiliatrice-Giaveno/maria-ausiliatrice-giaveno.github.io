          <div class="body-text">Beatrice Vio is an Italian athlete, called Bebe by her supporters. She is 23 years old and she is an international and European champion of individual paralympic fencing. Bebe was born in Venice on March 4th, 1997. Since she was a child, she has always been lively and full of interests, for example for school, art, scouts…but mostly for fencing: Bebe started practicing fencing at the age of 6! When she was eleven, she was unfortunately affected by a big infection called meningitis and they had to amputate her legs and her forearms. But, after only one year, she started her beloved fencing again thanks to some prosthesis that could hold her foil. And she became a champion! From there on, she became one of the most important testimonials to make people know about fencing in a wheel chair.  In 2009, Beatrice’s family founded art4sport, an ONLUS to support the social integration of disabled children through sports. </div>
