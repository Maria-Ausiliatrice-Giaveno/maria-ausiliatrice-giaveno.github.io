            <div class="body-text" align="justify">Grazia Deledda was born in Nuoro in 1871 into a wealthy family and she was the fifth of seven brothers and sisters. Immediately after primary school she began her self-taught studies and at the age of fifteen she wrote her first short story. At nineteen years old she wrote her first novel, but her family was scandalized and furthermore in the Church she was warned by the priest that said:” it would be better if she prayed more instead of writing inappropriate stories!”</div>
            <image class="project-header-image" src="../assets/images/Grazia Deledda2.jpg">
            <div class="body-text" align="justify">In 1900 she moved to Rome with her husband and she entered into intellectual life. In 1903 with “Elias Portolu” and “Canne al vento” in 1913, Deledda started writing novels which gained international success. In 1908 she participated at the first Italian Women's Congress, organized by the pedagogist Maria Montessori from Italy. There, she met Benito Mussolini and he complimented her asking what he could do for her. So she asked to bring back an anti-fascist friend from confinement and during her speech for the Nobel prize she made it clear she didn't support the regime.</div>
            <div class="body-text" align="justify">Flocks of journalists and photographers started visiting her home in Rome. Deledda initially welcomed them but eventually grew tired of the attention. Then she continued to write even as she grew older and more fragile. Her subsequent works, The House of the Poet in 1930 and the Summer Sun in 1933, indicate a more optimistic view of life even as she was experiencing serious health issues. Deledda died in Rome at the age of 64 of breast cancer. The Church of Solitude in 1936, Deledda's last novel, is a semi-autobiographical depiction of a young Italian woman coming to terms with a fatal disease and finally a completed manuscript of the novel Cosima was discovered after her death and published posthumously in 1937.</div>
