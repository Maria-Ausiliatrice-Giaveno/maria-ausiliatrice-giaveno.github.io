          <div class="body-text" align="justify">In 1928, at the age of 18, she decided to become a nun. She was sent to Calcutta, India, in 1929. She was a teacher at the Catholic School for Girls "St. Mary" since 1937 and then director of the same school since 1944. On 21 December 1946, she went to the suburbs for the first time: she visited families, washed the wounds of some children, and took care of an elderly man lying sick on the road and a woman dying of hunger and tuberculosis. She went out every day with the rosary in her hands, to seek and serve Jesus in those who are "unwanted, unloved, untreated". A few months later she was joined, one by one, by some of her former students. In 1950 she started a new Congregation of Sisters, the Missionaries of Charity. Mother Teresa and her sisters took care of leprosy patients and the poorest in India. Then Venezuela, Tanzania, and all the continents. From 1980 until 1990, Mother Teresa opened mission houses in almost all communist countries, including the former Soviet Union, Albania, and Cuba.</div>

	  <div class="body-text" align="justify">1. In 1998 an Indian woman, Monica Besra, of Hindu faith and originally from a village north of Calcutta, was ill with abdominal cancer and tubercular meningitis. On September 5, the woman prayed with the sisters and said she had seen a photograph of Mother Teresa and was struck by a ray of light that came from her eyes. In the afternoon, Monica Besra placed a small medallion of Mother Teresa on the protuberance on her abdomen and continued to pray. The next morning, she felt light: she called the woman who was sleeping next to her to tell her that the bump had disappeared.</div>
	  <div class="body-text" align="justify">2.  Marcilio Haddad Andrino, a Brazilian engineer born in Santos in 1973, began to suffer from violent headaches in 2006. In October 2008, he was diagnosed with eight brain abscesses and severe hydrocephalus. On December 9, 2008, following a sudden worsening, he was taken to the operating room, but before the surgery, he had felt healed, and the doctors had noticed the sudden and inexplicable disappearance of hydrocephalus and abscesses. During his illness Marcilio’s wife, Fernanda Rocha Andrino, had prayed for her husband, applying a relic of Mother Teresa to his head. Later the couple had two children, while this possibility had been excluded by doctors because of the treatment attempted by Marcilio during the illness.</div>
