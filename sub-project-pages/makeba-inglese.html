Miriam Makeba collaborated with a lot of artists from different cultures and countries. She mixed all the influences received and she made a unique style, she mixed every African traditional sound with jazz, pop, and folk. Her music was called world music because it was influenced by different cultures. In the 1990s, Miriam Makeba took part in the Festival di Sanremo (an edition with foreign singers) with the song “Give Me a Reason” but one of the most iconic songs was Pata Pata. It was made in 1967 and it mixed African rhythms with modern sounds and shows the big voice of Miriam Makeba. Pata Pata was sung in the Xhosa language, one of the official languages of South Africa.The text describes a dance with the title of Pata Pata which refers to the applause during the dance. The song became a global success, and it helped Miriam Makeba to become an ambassador of global African music.</div>
	<div class="subheader-text" align="justify">Biography</div>
	  <div class="body-text" align="justify">Miriam Makeba was born on the 4th of March 1932 in Johannesburg, during the Apartheid period. Her life changed when in the 50s she met Nelson Mandela, who inspired her with a sense of hope and freedom. She started her singer life, and she became a star even outside of her country with the musical group Manhattan Brothers in 1959. Miriam had a small role in an anti-apartheid movie. But after the first tour in the USA, she was exiled by the South African government, because she was considered dangerous, being a symbol of oppressed people that wanted freedom.The exile lasted 30 years, but while she was in America, she recorded her first solo album with the help of Harry Belafonte, and she became the first African artist to win a Grammy Award.Unfortunately, even in America, Miriam encountered serious difficulties and after her marriage to Stokely Carmicheal, a leader of the radical black movements, her residence permit was revoked. After that, she decided to return to Africa and found a second residence permit in Guinea.As a delegate from Guinea, she took part in various diplomatic missions to the National Unit and thanks to her civil commitment, she received awards from various organizations (such as UNESCO) as well as meeting great leaders such as John Kennedy, Fidel Castro, Mitterrand… With the end of apartheid in 1990, she started singing again and became involved in various humanitarian projects including the protection of black women. Miriam died in Italy, in Castel Volturno, on the night of November 2008 after finishing her last performance.</div>
